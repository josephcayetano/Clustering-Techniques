# Clustering Techniques
### Overview
This project focuses on patient segmentation using K-means clustering to uncover meaningful patterns that support targeted hospital interventions.

### K-means Clustering â€“ Patient Segmentation
-	Applied K-means clustering (Python, scikit-learn) to segment patients into 4 distinct groups based on demographics, medical conditions, and hospitalization details.
-	Conducted Elbow Method analysis to determine optimal clusters; visualized clusters with scatterplots and interpreted group characteristics to inform targeted hospital strategies.
-	Recommended data-driven interventions (e.g., discharge planning, chronic care) to reduce readmissions and optimize hospital costs.
