# Clustering Techniques
### Overview
This project used K-means clustering to group patients into segments and find patterns that can help hospitals plan better care.

### K-means Clustering â€“ Patient Segmentation
-	Used K-means clustering in Python to group patients into 4 clusters based on demographics, health conditions, and hospital stay details
-	Used the Elbow Method to choose the best number of clusters and visualized results with scatterplots to understand each group
-	Suggested care strategies like better discharge planning and chronic care support to help reduce readmissions and lower hospital costs
